# Factor Rating Analysis for Potential Lunar Mining Facility #

This repository archives the 2020 ATMAE conference paper, "Factor Rating Analysis for Potential Lunar Mining Facility," which details a methodology for complex site selection under conditions of limited baseline knowledge.


## Significance of the Methodology ##

The paper employs the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), a versatile and systematic decision-making tool used for over forty years in diverse fields such as industrial engineering, strategic planning, and aerospace applications. AHP provides a structured approach for high-level planners to narrow a wide range of options into a set of feasible solutions.

The process works by identifying key factors, weighting their relative importance, and using pairwise comparisons to compute a quantitative score for each alternative. This makes it an effective strategy for simplifying complex decisions, such as selecting a site for a future lunar facility, where a methodical evaluation of key factors can help mitigate high operational risks.


## Abstract from Source Publication ##

> Factor rating analysis may be an effective strategy for determining emplacement of a future mining facility on the lunar
surface. With NASA and commercial ventures planning new missions to the Moon via the Artemis program, a critical driver
will be a long-term liquid oxygen (LOX) processing facility to maintain a permanent presence. While a lunar mining facility
is not in NASAâ€™s first phase of their return to the Moon program, it is an important operational component in their long-term
strategy of permanent presence. The facility at Shackleton Crater was chosen by weighted criteria derived from the ana-
lytic hierarchy process (AHP). By assessing the following six key factors: (1) Power, (2) Communication, (3) Site Access, (4)
Protection, (5) Transportation and Logistics, and (6) Safety Egress via AHP, a viable solution could be made for determining
a proposed facility location, especially when baseline knowledge is limited. While risks in all operational areas are high, a
methodical evaluation of the key factors could potentially drive down some of those risks, specifically if site access and
manufacturing are co-located with one another to minimize logistical needs. Our analysis assessed a research site on the
ridge of Shackleton crater to test out unique mining and manufacturing techniques for lunar ice in the sub-surface soil of the
permanently shadowed regions. Future lunar mission planners may use AHP prior to prospecting surveys for site selection
of a pathfinder outpost site. This site could then scale up to a full lunar mining facility, thereby potentially satisfying the
demands of future lunar surface operations.
